           <h1>Interface for Autopose at Leidos</h1>

           <p> In the Summer of 2022, I worked as a software intern at <a href = "https://www.leidos.com/markets/aviation/security-detection/aviation-checkpoint">Leidos</a> on an R&D team.
            I worked on creating a visual to help a user align themselves properly for a millimeter wave body scan.
           </p>
           <p>This was built in Unity with C#. Our prototype was shown to the CEO and is currently being tested at various checkpoints.</p>
